#📚 Book-stall-website
🚀 This project is a simple yet functional Book Stall Website that enables users to register, log in, and search for books from a predefined collection. The website features a user-friendly interface designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with backend logic implemented using PHP and data storage handled via a MySQL database.

During registration, user inputs like name, email, password, mobile number, gender, and role are collected and validated on both the frontend (JavaScript) and backend (PHP) for security and accuracy. Once successfully registered, user data is securely stored in the MySQL database.

The login functionality ensures only registered users can access the book search features. Upon logging in, users can view and search the available books, making it a basic but useful system for managing book stalls or small-scale libraries.

This project serves as a great starting point for learning full-stack web development and is ideal for students or beginners exploring PHP-MySQL integration and form handling with validation.
